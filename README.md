## Hotel Booking Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to identify cancellation patterns and propose strategies to reduce cancellations and secure revenue.

### Project Overview

The dataset comprises booking details for a city hotel and a resort hotel, including information such as booking dates, length of stay, number of adults, and children. This project leverages Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques to gain insights from the data.

### Goals

- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset.
- Uncover patterns in booking cancellations.
- Recommend practical measures to mitigate cancellations and boost revenue.

### Proposed Solutions

- Implement discounts or promotions for early bookings or longer stays.
- Offer incentives like free parking or breakfast for direct bookings instead of through third-party platforms.

### EDA Process

1. *Data Exploration and Inspection*: Initial examination of the raw data to understand its structure.
2. *Data Cleaning*: Resolving data impurities by handling null values and removing irrelevant entries.

### Analysis Breakdown

1. *Univariate Analysis*: Analyzing single variables to understand their distributions.
2. *Bivariate Analysis*: Comparing two variables to explore their relationships.
3. *Multivariate Analysis*: Analyzing more than two variables to uncover complex interactions.

### Conclusion

By thoroughly analyzing hotel booking data and identifying cancellation trends, hotels can implement effective strategies to reduce cancellations and enhance revenue.
